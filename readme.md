The folder `./code` contains jupyter notebooks that walk replicate the two experiments in the paper. 
- The first experiment, that assesses the accuracy of detecting anomalous IBIs, is available in `anomaly_experiment.ipynb`.
- The second experiment, that compares the validity of HRV estimation using the proposed filter is realized in `hrv_experiment.ipynb`
